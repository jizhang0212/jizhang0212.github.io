# About Me

<img src="https://jizhang0212.github.io/jizhang.JPG" width="63%" class="floatpic">

Hi! I’m **Ji Zhang (张骥)**, and welcome to my corner of the web.

I am a graduate student in the [STANDS program (Statistics, Analytics and Data Science)](https://stor.unc.edu/ms/program/) at the Department of Statistics and Operations Research (STOR), **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)**. Before joining UNC, I studied Statistics at Shenzhen University, where I strengthened my skills in data analysis and statistical modeling. During my undergraduate studies, I also built a foundation in machine learning and deep learning, and gained hands-on experience in solving real-world problems using R and Python.

In summer 2024, I participated in the Center for Interdisciplinary Scholarship Summer Research Program on *Data Science Methods and Applications in Public Health and Biomedicine*. Under the mentorship of [Prof. Hui Zhang](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=45854) at Northwestern University, I led a project analyzing comparative efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer, which was published in *Theoretical and Natural Science*. This experience strengthened my leadership skills, deepened my expertise in survival analysis, and further fueled my passion for applying data science to real-world biomedical challenges.

I always welcome opportunities to collaborate on research. Feel free to reach out to me at jizhang0212@gmail.com.
