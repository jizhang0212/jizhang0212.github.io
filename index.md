# About Me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hi! I’m <strong>Ji Zhang (张骥)</strong>, and welcome to my corner of the web.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a graduate student in the <a href="https://stor.unc.edu/ms/program/">STANDS program (Statistics, Analytics and Data Science)</a> at the Department of Statistics and Operations Research (STOR), <strong>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)</strong>. Before joining UNC, I studied Statistics at Shenzhen University, where I strengthened my skills in data analysis and statistical modeling. During my undergraduate studies, I also built a foundation in machine learning and deep learning, and gained hands-on experience in solving real-world problems using R and Python.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summer 2024, I participated in the Center for Interdisciplinary Scholarship Summer Research Program on <em>Data Science Methods and Applications in Public Health and Biomedicine</em>. Under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=45854">Prof. Hui Zhang</a> at Northwestern University, I led a project analyzing comparative efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer, which was published in <em>Theoretical and Natural Science</em>. This experience strengthened my leadership skills, deepened my expertise in survival analysis, and further fueled my passion for applying data science to real-world biomedical challenges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I always welcome opportunities to collaborate on research. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:jizhang0212@gmail.com">jizhang0212@gmail.com</a>.
