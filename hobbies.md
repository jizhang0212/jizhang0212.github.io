Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling and exercising. Traveling allows me to explore new cultures, experience local customs and traditions, gain fresh perspectives, and broaden my understanding of the world. Regular exercise helps me stay physically healthy, relieve stress, and maintain focus for my studies and research. Together, these activities keep me balanced, energized, and inspired in both my personal and academic life.

Travel is my greatest joy during breaks and my deepest anticipation after a busy semester. It offers a feast for the eyes and relaxation for both mind and spirit, as well as the gift of wonderful, unexpected encounters. I have journeyed across much of Chinaâ€”from dawn's first light to twilight's embrace, across sun-drenched beaches and mist-shrouded peaks, over sweeping plains to towering summits, through scorching deserts and the biting cold of the mountains. Now, as I plan my next adventure, I am guided by the timeless truth: *"To travel is to live."*
