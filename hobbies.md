Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling and exercising. Traveling allows me to explore new cultures, experience local customs and traditions, gain fresh perspectives, and broaden my understanding of the world. Regular exercise helps me stay physically healthy, relieve stress, and maintain focus for my studies and research. Together, these activities keep me balanced, energized, and inspired in both my personal and academic life.
